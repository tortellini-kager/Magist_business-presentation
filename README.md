# Business partnership assessment conducted for WBS Coding School

## Summary
Our assessment examines whether partnering with Magist, a Brazilian SaaS provider, would benefit our company’s expansion into the country’s growing e-commerce market. Brazil’s rapid economic growth and large customer base present significant opportunities. While high-tech products make up only 11% of Magist’s total sales, demand in this segment has remained stable. Magist’s strong logistics network ensures reliable delivery, even in remote areas, and customer reviews indicate solid service quality. Given these factors, we conclude that a partnership with Magist would be a strategic move, allowing us to test the market and evaluate long-term potential.

## Languages and Libraries Used
The dataset was provided by WBS Coding School. SQL was used to extract key data for the project, while Tableau was utilized for visualization. The presentation was created using Gamma, and ChatGPT provided support throughout the process.

## Key Learnings 
The key skill required for this project was storytelling with data—extracting relevant insights and visualizing them effectively. This involved technical proficiency in SQL and Tableau, both of which I had the opportunity to practice. In particular, I learned new Tableau techniques, such as creating maps and highlighting key information. Equally important was collaborating within an intercultural team, where each of my three teammates brought different professional backgrounds and technical skill levels. We effectively supported those who needed guidance with Tableau, distributed tasks based on skill levels, and coordinated our work using Slack, Google Meet, and Google Sheets.

## Challenges Overcame
[Share any challenges encountered during the project and how you overcame them.]
A challange I faced was my limited skills in Tableau. To improve, I used ChatGPT for step-by-step guidance on creating specific graphs, which was helpful to an extent but not sufficient for more complex visualizations. Since I had three teammates, we divided tasks strategically—I focused on creating basic graphs and took the lead on writing the script and designing the presentation in Gamma, while teammates with more Tableau experience handled the more detailed and complex visualizations.
